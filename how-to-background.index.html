  <h5>As you may already know, you can style your background in many ways, from changing the color to adding a nice picture. All to make your Web page look more attractive. If you are reading this, most likely you want to learn how to place a good-looking-picture on to your background... let's get to it!</h5>
  
    <p>When adding a background image there is a thing or two to consider: how much space you want it to take, and where to place it.</p>
	<p>First of all, lets talk about adding a background image to your Web page. You will need to add the following element to your CSS to be able to do this. <span>background-image: url('your-files-path.jpg')</span></p>
	<p>When placing an image on your web page, think whether you want it on the header, or somewhere in the body. Play around with the <span>height</span> and the <span>width </span> of the background image to determine what suits you best.</p>
	
	<h5>What if you want your image to take up the whole page, and let's say you don't want the image to move when users scroll down the web page.</h5>
	
	<p>Follow the same steps to insert the background image as previously mentioned. The <span>height</span>and <span>width</span> need to take-up the whole screen whether the users have a small or big computer screen. Also, you need to set it up so it won't repeat, and somehow figure out a way to make the image stay in place...</p>
	<p>To do this you will want to insert the following elements for the size of the image,</p>
	<p><span>height: 100vh;</span></p>
	<p><span>width:100%;</span></p>
	<p><span>background-size: cover;</span></p>
	<p>To have the image stay in-place you will need to insert the following elements.</p>
	<p><span>background-repeat: no-repeat;</span></p>
	<p><span>background-attachment: fixed;</span></p>
	<br>
	<p>REMEMBER: if for some reason the background image is being stubborn, then take a look at <a href="C:\Users\mary_\programming\CodeCademy\projects\CheatSheetProject\cheat-sheet.index.html">Learn how to Input an Image in your HTML</a></p>
